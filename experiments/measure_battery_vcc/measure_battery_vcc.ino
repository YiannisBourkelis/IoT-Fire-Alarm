/*
* Experiment details
* =====================
* In this experiment we are trying to measure the battery voltage of the battery
* that powers the esp32
* 
*/

#define ADC_input_battery_pin   32

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input on analog pin 0:
  //int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  // print out the value you read:
  //Serial.println(sensorValue);
  Serial.println("test");
  float VBat = float(analogRead(ADC_input_battery_pin)) / 4096.0f * 3.3;    // 
  Serial.println(VBat);
  delay(500);        // delay in between reads for stability
}
